        FileProvider paths configuration for secure file access.
        
        This configuration enables the app to securely share photo files with the camera app
        and other external applications. Uses app-specific external storage that doesn't
        require storage permissions on Android 10+.
        
        Path types:
        - external-files-path: App-specific external files directory
        - PlantPhotos: Subdirectory for organizing plant photos
        
        Security: Files are only accessible to apps with proper URI permissions
